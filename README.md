#About
Press The Button is a game about endlessly spiraling sense of pointlessness and despair.

It is written on C and works on Windows. You need a Visual Studio 2013 to compile it (Express and Community versions will work).

It uses FreeType 2 library (used under FreeType license) enhanced with a patch for 64-bit environments that can be found at [Robert Rouhani's repo](https://github.com/Robmaister/SharpFont.Dependencies/blob/master/freetype2/win64.patch), and [Raleway font](https://github.com/theleagueof/raleway).

Game itself is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and distributed without any warranties. You can't use it on other terms, so you better read the license carefully. But you probably won't, so I can tell you it's kinda about "do what you want with it, but tell people that you used it and it's made by me".
